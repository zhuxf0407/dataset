We constructed a sentiment dataset associated with user information.  To this end, we randomly select 200 active users who has 50-50k followers as well as posts 100-1000 micro-blogs.   For each active user, we crawle their latest 100 micro-blogs and it results in more than 10k micro-blogs.  

We manually label all  blogs and obtain nearly 3000 micro-blogs with clear sentimental polarity (i.e., pos vs neg).
